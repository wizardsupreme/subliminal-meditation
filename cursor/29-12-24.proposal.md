# Subliminal Meditation App - Implementation Plan

## Overview

This document outlines the implementation plan for adding subliminal track features to the meditation app.

## Code Quality Standards

- Follow PEP 8 style guide for Python code
- Use type hints in Python functions
- Maintain consistent code formatting
- Keep functions focused and single-purpose
- Maximum line length: 100 characters
- Use meaningful variable and function names

### Import Standards

- All imports must be at the top of the file
- Group imports in the following order:
  1. Standard library imports
  2. Third-party imports
  3. Local application imports
- Separate import groups with a blank line
- No dynamic imports inside functions
- Use parentheses for multi-line imports
- Follow pylint and CodeQL import standards
- Avoid using `import *`
- Use absolute imports over relative imports

### Python Code Structure Rules

- Use consistent indentation (4 spaces)
- Ensure proper code block nesting
- Never place code after a return statement in the same block
- Define variables before using them
- Use blank lines to separate logical code sections
- Validate variable scope and accessibility
- Avoid unreachable code
- Add descriptive comments for complex logic
- Use early returns to reduce nesting

## Architecture Components

### 1. Database Schema Updates

* Add new tables for user's subliminal audio files and settings
* Store metadata about processed files
* Track user preferences and history

### 2. File Storage Integration

* Integrate with existing Firebase storage
* Organize user files in appropriate storage structure
* Handle file uploads and processing

### 3. Route Integration

* Add new routes under the existing blueprint structure
* Ensure proper authentication requirements
* Maintain existing security measures

### 4. Frontend Integration

* Add new templates following existing design patterns
* Integrate with current authentication system
* Maintain consistent UI/UX

## Implementation Steps

### Step 1: Database Schema

#### Models to Create:


1. SubliminalTrack
   * User relationship (Foreign Key)
   * Original music file path
   * Subliminal content (text or audio)
   * Frequency settings
   * Output file path
   * Creation timestamp
   * Processing status
   * Last modified timestamp
   * Track metadata (title, description, etc.)
2. UserPreferences
   * Default frequency settings
   * Preferred audio types
   * Custom configurations

#### Tasks:

* Create new models
* Add relationships to User model
* Create and run migrations
* Add model tests

### Step 2: Backend Routes

#### New Routes:

* Track upload and management
* Audio processing endpoints
* User preferences management
* Track playback and streaming

#### Tasks:

* Add new routes to handle audio processing
* Integrate with Firebase storage
* Add authentication requirements
* Implement error handling
* Add route tests

### Step 3: Frontend Templates

#### New Pages:

* Track management dashboard
* Upload interface
* Processing status view
* Playback interface

#### Tasks:

* Create new templates
* Add to navigation
* Implement form handling
* Add client-side validation
* Ensure responsive design

### Step 4: Audio Processing Integration

#### Components:

* Audio processing pipeline
* Firebase storage integration
* Background job processing
* Error handling system

#### Tasks:

* Port the audio processing code
* Integrate with Firebase storage
* Add comprehensive error handling
* Implement job queue system
* Add processing status updates

## Security Considerations

* Secure file uploads
* User data protection
* API endpoint security
* Storage access controls

## Performance Optimization

* Efficient file processing
* Caching strategy
* Resource optimization
* Load balancing

## Testing Strategy

* Unit tests for models
* Integration tests for routes
* Frontend testing
* Performance testing

## Deployment Plan

* Database migrations
* Feature flagging
* Staged rollout
* Monitoring setup
